The system recognizes particles from video clips, determines their characteristics and runs a tracking algorithm on all frames from the video. It then visualizes the result and calculates the exact characteristics. 

- changes in coordinates of the centers of particles of different shapes (round, rectangular, polygonal, etc.); 
- changes in rotation angle;
- track the speed of movement and rotation of particles.
